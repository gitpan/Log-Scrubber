=== version history of Log::Scrubber

version 0.10: 2012-10-12 Jason Terry

    - do not attempt to scrub undefined values, this avoids warnings about undef

	- fix a bug when scrubbing a hash key, it was deleting the root key... not
	the nested key.

    - update the perldoc

version 0.09: 2012-10-11 Jason Terry

    - possible warn about undefined values during import

    - Don't improperly return a sub-item during scrubbing if a nested object is found

    - Allow override methods during import ie "use Log::Scrubber (+custom::method);"

    - Make scrubber work more intuitively with a single value
